    <hr>
    <p id="par1">George Perry Floyd Jr. (October 14, 1973 â€“ May 25, 2020) was an African-American man who was murdered
        by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during an arrest after a store clerk suspected Floyd may have
        used a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill, on May 25, 2020. Derek Chauvin, one of four police officers who
        arrived on the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck and back for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. After his murder, protests
        against police brutality, especially towards black people, quickly spread across the United States and globally.
        His dying words, "I can't breathe," became a rallying cry.

        Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Floyd grew up in Houston, Texas, playing football and basketball
        throughout high school and college. Between 1997 and 2005, he was convicted of eight crimes. He served four
        years in prison after accepting a plea bargain for a 2007 aggravated robbery in a home invasion.After he was
        paroled in 2013, he served as a mentor in his religious community and posted anti-violence videos to social
        media. In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis area, residing in the nearby suburb of St. Louis Park,
        and worked as a truck driver and bouncer. In 2020, he lost his job as a truck driver, and then his security job
        during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        The City of Minneapolis settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Floyd's family for $27 million. Chauvin was
        convicted on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter on April 20, 2021 and on June 25, 2021, was
        sentenced to 22.5 years in prison. The other three officers at the scene were also later convicted of
        violating Floyd's civil rights.</p>
